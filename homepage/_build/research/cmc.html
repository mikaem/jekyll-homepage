<h1 id="Turbulent-Combustion">Turbulent Combustion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Turbulent-Combustion"> </a></h1><p>For my PhD
thesis, and subsequent year as Post Doc at the University of Sydney, Australia,<br>
I worked mostly with the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128599000064">Conditional Moment Closure</a> (CMC), a
state-of-the-art model that is used to capture turbulence-chemistry
interactions (e.g., {% cite mortensen_ces mortensen_ctm %}. From 2005-2006 I had the great honour of working with Prof. Robert W. Bilger as a Post Doctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney,
Australia. In Sydney I worked on CMC for spray combustion {% cite Mortensen_Bilger %} and a
version of my consistent turbulent mixer model
{% cite mortensen_pof %} that I have called the
presumed mapping function approach {% cite Mortensen2006 ahmad_2014 %}. The
presumed mapping functions have been implemented in the open source package
<a href="http://launchpad.net/pmfpack">PMFpack</a>, available under a GNU Lesser General Public License.
 My work on CMC led to several papers in collaboration with <a href="https://mie.umass.edu/faculty/stephen-de-bruyn-kops">Prof. Steve de Bruyn
Kops</a>, using very large Direct Numerical Simulations to validate
turbulence-chemistry models {% cite de2005conditional cha2006direct mortensen2007direct %}.</p>
